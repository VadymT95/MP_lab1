The rate of fission reactions within a reactor core can be adjusted by controlling
 the quantity of neutrons that are able to induce further fission events. Nuclear 
reactors typically employ several methods of neutron control to adjust the reactor's
 power output. Some of these methods arise naturally from the physics of radioactive
 decay and are simply accounted for during the reactor's operation, while others are 
mechanisms engineered into the reactor design for a distinct purpose.

The fastest method for adjusting levels of fission-inducing neutrons in a reactor is 
via movement of the control rods. Control rods are made of neutron poisons and therefore
 absorb neutrons. When a control rod is inserted deeper into the reactor, it absorbs 
more neutrons than the material it displaces – often the moderator. This action results
 in fewer neutrons available to cause fission and reduces the reactor's power output.
 Conversely, extracting the control rod will result in an increase in the rate of fission
 events and an increase in power.

The physics of radioactive decay also affects neutron populations in a reactor. One 
such process is delayed neutron emission by a number of neutron-rich fission isotopes.
 These delayed neutrons account for about 0.65% of the total neutrons produced in 
fission, with the remainder (termed "prompt neutrons") released immediately upon 
fission. The fission products which produce delayed neutrons have half-lives for their 
decay by neutron emission that range from milliseconds to as long as several minutes,
 and so considerable time is required to determine exactly when a reactor reaches the
 critical point. Keeping the reactor in the zone of chain reactivity where delayed 
neutrons are necessary to achieve a critical mass state allows mechanical devices or 
human operators to control a chain reaction in "real time"; otherwise the time between
 achievement of criticality and nuclear meltdown as a result of an exponential power
 surge from the normal nuclear chain reaction, would be too short to allow for intervention. 
This last stage, where delayed neutrons are no longer required to maintain criticality,
 is known as the prompt critical point. There is a scale for describing criticality
 in numerical form, in which bare criticality is known as zero dollars and the prompt
 critical point is one dollar, and other points in the process interpolated in cents.

In some reactors, the coolant also acts as a neutron moderator. A moderator increases
 the power of the reactor by causing the fast neutrons that are released from fission
 to lose energy and become thermal neutrons. Thermal neutrons are more likely than
 fast neutrons to cause fission. If the coolant is a moderator, then temperature changes
 can affect the density of the coolant/moderator and therefore change power output.
 A higher temperature coolant would be less dense, and therefore a less effective moderator.

In other reactors the coolant acts as a poison by absorbing neutrons in the same way 
that the control rods do. In these reactors power output can be increased by heating
 the coolant, which makes it a less dense poison. Nuclear reactors generally have 
automatic and manual systems to scram the reactor in an emergency shut down. These 
systems insert large amounts of poison (often boron in the form of boric acid) into
 the reactor to shut the fission reaction down if unsafe conditions are detected or anticipated.[9]

Most types of reactors are sensitive to a process variously known as xenon poisoning,
 or the iodine pit. The common fission product Xenon-135 produced in the fission process
 acts as a neutron poison that absorbs neutrons and therefore tends to shut the reactor
 down. Xenon-135 accumulation can be controlled by keeping power levels high enough to
 destroy it by neutron absorption as fast as it is produced. Fission also produces
 iodine-135, which in turn decays (with a half-life of 6.57 hours) to new xenon-135. 
When the reactor is shut down, iodine-135 continues to decay to xenon-135, making 
restarting the reactor more difficult for a day or two, as the xenon-135 decays into 
cesium-135, which is not nearly as poisonous as xenon-135, with a half-life of 9.2 hours.
 This temporary state is the "iodine pit." If the reactor has sufficient extra reactivity
 capacity, it can be restarted. As the extra xenon-135 is transmuted to xenon-136, which
 is much less a neutron poison, within a few hours the reactor experiences a "xenon burnoff 
(power) transient". Control rods must be further inserted to replace the neutron absorption 
of the lost xenon-135. Failure to properly follow such a procedure was a key step 
in the Chernobyl disaster.[10]

Reactors used in nuclear marine propulsion (especially nuclear submarines) often cannot
 be run at continuous power around the clock in the same way that land-based power 
reactors are normally run, and in addition often need to have a very long core life 
without refueling. For this reason many designs use highly enriched uranium but incorporate
 burnable neutron poison in the fuel rods.[11] This allows the reactor to be constructed
 with an excess of fissionable material, which is nevertheless made relatively safe early 
in the reactor's fuel burn cycle by the presence of the neutron-absorbing material which is
 later replaced by normally produced long-lived neutron poisons (far longer-lived than xenon-135)
 which gradually accumulate over the fuel load's operating life.
The neutron was discovered in 1932 by British physicist James Chadwick. The concept of
 a nuclear chain reaction brought about by nuclear reactions mediated by neutrons was 
first realized shortly thereafter, by Hungarian scientist Leó Szilárd, in 1933. He filed 
a patent for his idea of a simple reactor the following year while working at the Admiralty 
in London.[12] However, Szilárd's idea did not incorporate the idea of nuclear fission as a
 neutron source, since that process was not yet discovered. Szilárd's ideas for nuclear
 reactors using neutron-mediated nuclear chain reactions in light elements proved unworkable.
Inspiration for a new type of reactor using uranium came from the discovery by Lise Meitner
 Fritz Strassmann and Otto Hahn in 1938 that bombardment of uranium with neutrons (provided
 by an alpha-on-beryllium fusion reaction, a "neutron howitzer") produced a barium residue, 
which they reasoned was created by the fissioning of the uranium nuclei. Subsequent studies 
in early 1939 (one of them by Szilárd and Fermi) revealed that several neutrons were also
 released during the fissioning, making available the opportunity for the nuclear chain reaction
 that Szilárd had envisioned six years previously.
